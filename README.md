# Day-22_Pong_Game

Make left paddle controlled by computer.

I tracked the position of the ball and make left peddle follow the ball.
Instead of using goto method, I use functions to decide the left paddle to go up or down in a constant speed.
If using the goto method, it would make the paddle go to the balls position as fast ad possible, and that would make the computer unbeatable.

Here's my demo video:

There seems to be a bug , that when the paddle hit the ball on the edge, the ball would bounce extremely fast.
Currently I am not able to spot it and fix it, If someone knows what's wrong with my code or how to fix it, please kindly let me know. :)
